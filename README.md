         1. Preservation of Document Structure: Reformatted research papers into hierarchical, nested JSON format to preserve structural elements (e.g., headings, sections)  
         2. Files were retrieved and processed in batches of 30 for efficient handling.  
      3. **Prompt Generation:**  
         1. **Purpose**: Prompts are generated to guide the AI in extracting relevant information from the papers.  
         2. **Types of Prompts**:  
            1. Broad conceptual prompts (e.g., "Explain the concept of transaction costs in financial markets and their overall impact on investment strategies")  
            2. Strategy-specific prompts (e.g., "Describe how high-frequency trading strategies are adapted to minimize the impact of transaction costs")  
            3. Methodology-focused prompts (e.g., "Outline common methods for measuring and modeling transaction costs in portfolio management")  
            4. Trend analysis prompts (e.g., "Identify emerging trends in how investment firms are addressing transaction costs in the age of algorithmic trading")  
      4. **Prompt Refinement:** Iterative process of testing prompts against a sample of papers to ensure they elicit relevant and comprehensive responses  
         1. **Initial Prompt Creation**  
            1. **Objective**: Start by formulating an initial prompt based on the specific financial question or concept you want the AI to analyze.  
            2. **Example**: If you're researching transaction costs, your initial prompt might be: "What are the key components of transaction costs in financial trading?"

         2. **Input the Prompt into SciSpace Copilot:** Enter the prompt into SciSpace Copilot. This AI tool will process your prompt and search through relevant research papers, extracting information or directing you to specific sections that may provide an answer.

         3. **Review and Analyze the Results**

            1. **Objective**: Carefully examine the information that SciSpace provides. Evaluate whether the results are relevant and comprehensive.

            2. **Assessment Criteria**:

               * **Relevance**: Are the papers or sections identified by SciSpace directly related to the concept you're interested in?  
               * **Completeness**: Does the AI retrieve all necessary components, or are there gaps in the information?  
               * **Clarity**: Is the extracted information clear and actionable, or is it too vague or broad?  
         4. **Identify Gaps or Issues:** Too Broad, Too Specific,   
         5. **Refine the Prompt**  
            * **For More Specificity**:    
              * **Example**: Refine "What are the key components of transaction costs in financial trading?" to "What are the implicit and explicit components of transaction costs in high-frequency trading?"  
            * **For Broader Results**:    
              * **Example**: Broaden "What are the implicit costs of transaction fees in the Forex market?" to "What are the main types of transaction costs in financial markets?"  
         6. **Re-Enter the Refined Prompt and Iterate the Process:** Input the refined prompt back into SciSpace Copilot. Continue this cycle of prompt refinement and analysis. Each iteration should bring you closer to a prompt that yields the most relevant and comprehensive results.  
         7. **Apply the Refined Prompt to the Full Corpus:** Use the finalized prompt to analyze the 200 PDFs. The refined prompt should now reliably extract relevant and accurate information from the corpus of financial papers.  
         8. **Impact on Chunking**: The prompt generation process influences the subsequent chunking by:  
            1. Providing specific areas of focus for content extraction  
            2. Guiding the relevance scoring of text segments  
            3. Ensuring that chunks contain information pertinent to the generated prompts  
      5. **Text Chunking and Relevance Ranking**  
         1. **Chunking Technique**: Utilized Tada's technology for dynamic text chunking  
         2. Chunk Size: Text segments of 50-1500 words were extracted from documents.  
         3. Relevance Scoring: A reranker was employed to select the top 20 most relevant chunks per batch, with a minimum relevance threshold of 0.25.  
      6. **AI-Powered Quote Generation**   
         1. The Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct AI model is used to generate quotes from the document chunks.   
         2. Input: The AI model receives chunks of text from the original documents along with a specific prompt or question.  
         3. Processing: The model analyzes the text, understanding the context and the prompt.   
         4. Quote Extraction: Based on its analysis, the AI identifies and extracts relevant quotes that address the given prompt.  
         5. Output: The model produces a set of quotes it deems most relevant and important.   
         6. Key Point: While the AI is instructed to extract verbatim quotes, there's always a possibility of slight inaccuracies or misinterpretations.   
      7. **Quote Verification and Matching:** To ensure accuracy, a verification process is implemented using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity:   
         1. TF-IDF Vectorization: Both the AI-generated quotes and the original text are converted into numerical vectors that represent the importance of words in the context of the document.   
         2. Cosine Similarity Calculation: The similarity between each AI-generated quote and sentences from the original text is calculated using cosine similarity of their TF-IDF vectors.  
         3. Threshold Application: A similarity score of 0.3 is used as the minimum threshold. Scores above this threshold indicate a valid match.   
         4. Best Match Selection: The sentence from the original text with the highest similarity score above the threshold is selected as the match for the AI-generated quote.  
4. **Key Capabilities**

7. **Future Research Directions**  
   1. **Source Evaluation and Network Analysis**: Incorporating Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) into the analysis of finance papers can enhance the source evaluation process. By representing papers as nodes and their relationships as weighted edges based on factors like author credibility, journal quality, and citation impact, an MST can give more weight to highly respected sources in finance, potentially improving the quality of extracted information. This network analysis approach allows for the identification of key papers, clustering of related research, and visualization of the field's structure.  
   2. **Enhanced Natural Language Processing**: Improve chunking techniques to better capture complete thoughts while maintaining contextual relevance.  
   3. **Dynamic Research Database**: Create a continuously updated database of research papers and social media insight to implement real-time analysis capabilities to quickly identify emerging trends or strategy ideas.  
9. **Conclusion**: This AI-driven approach to financial research and strategy development represents a significant advancement in how we process and synthesize financial literature. By leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques, we can uncover insights and develop strategies more efficiently than ever before. As we continue to refine these tools, the potential for discovering novel approaches to financial problems is immense.
